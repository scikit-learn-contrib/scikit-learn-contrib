# scikit-learn-contrib

scikit-learn-contrib is a github organization for gathering high-quality [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org) compatible projects.  It also provides a [template](https://github.com/scikit-learn-contrib/project-template) for establishing new scikit-learn compatible projects.

# Vision

With the explosion of the number of machine learning papers, it becomes increasingly difficult for users and researchers to implement and compare algorithms. Even when authors release their software, it takes time to learn how to use it and how to apply it to one's own purposes. The goal of scikit-learn-contrib is to provide **easy-to-install** and **easy-to-use** high-quality machine learning software. With scikit-learn-contrib, users can install a project by ``pip install sklearn-contrib-project-name`` and immediately try it on their data with the usual ``fit``, ``predict`` and ``transform`` methods. In addition, projects are compatible with scikit-learn tools such as grid search, pipelines, etc.

# Projects

If you would like to include your own project in scikit-learn-contrib,
take a look at the [workflow](https://github.com/scikit-learn-contrib/scikit-learn-contrib/blob/master/workflow.md).

## [boruta_py](https://github.com/scikit-learn-contrib/boruta_py)

Python implementations of the Boruta all-relevant feature selection method.

Maintained by [Daniel Homola](https://github.com/danielhomola)

## [categorical-encoding](http://github.com/scikit-learn-contrib/categorical-encoding)

A library of sklearn compatible categorical variable encoders.

Maintained by [Will McGinnis](https://github.com/wdm0006) and [Paul Westenthanner](https://github.com/PaulWestenthanner)

## [DenMune: Density-peak clustering using mutual nearest neighbors](https://github.com/scikit-learn-contrib/denmune-clustering-algorithm)

A simple-but-efficient density-based clustering algorithm that can find clusters of arbitrary size, shapes and densities in two-dimensions. Higher dimensions are first reduced to 2-D using the t-sne. The algorithm relies on a single parameter K, the number of nearest neighbors.
